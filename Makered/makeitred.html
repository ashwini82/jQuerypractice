  <h1>Leadership</h1>
  
	
	<p>	No one can be authentic by trying to imitatesomeone else. You can learn from others’ expe-riences, but there is no way you can be success-ful when you are trying to be like them. Peopletrust you when you are genuine and authentic,not a replica of someone else.</p>
	<p> Amgen CEO andpresident  Kevin  Sharer,  who  gained  pricelessexperience working as Jack Welch’s assistant inthe 1980s, saw the downside of GE’s cult of per-sonality in those days. “Everyone wanted to belike  Jack,”  he  explains.  “Leadership  has  manyvoices."</p>
    <p>  While  the  life  stories  of  authentic  leaderscover  the  full  spectrum  of  experiences—including  the  positive  impact  of  parents,  ath-letic  coaches,  teachers,  and  mentors—manyleaders  reported  that  their  motivation  camefrom  a  difficult  experience  in  their  lives.</p>  
    <p>Theydescribed the transformative effects of the lossof a job; personal illness; the untimely death ofa close friend or relative; and feelings of beingexcluded,  discriminated  against,  and  rejectedby peers. Rather than seeing themselves as vic-tims, though, authentic leaders used these for-mative  experiences  to  give  meaning  to  theirlives. They reframed these events to rise abovetheir  challenges.</p>
    <p>There are times when we react too quicklyand  fail  to  realize  immediately  what  is  rightand wrong,” Huntsman recalled. “This was oneof those times when I didn’t think it through. Iknew  instinctively  it  was  wrong,  but  it  took  afewminutes  for  the  notion  to  percolate. </p> 
   	<p>After15  minutes,  my  inner  moral  compass  made  it-self  noticed  and  enabled  me  to  recognize  thiswasn’t the right thing to do. Values that had ac-companied me since childhood kicked in. Half-way  through  my  conversation  with  our  plantmanager, I said to him, ‘Let’s not do this. I don’twant to play this game. Forget that I called it.</p>
